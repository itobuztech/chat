# P2P Chat Express App

Minimal Express server bootstrapped with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (ships with npm)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start in development mode (auto-restarts on changes):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build and run production bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

The server listens on `http://localhost:3000` by default. Adjust the port via the `PORT` environment variable.

## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```
